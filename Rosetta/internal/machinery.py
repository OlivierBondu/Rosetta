__doc__ = '''
Rosetta's machinery for generating the translation paths available for the set 
of Basis implementations contained in its root directory. relate() builds
the possible translation paths from one basis to all of the others by looking 
for translation functions belonging to the class tagged by the translation 
decorator. The relationships dictionary contains all of this information and 
is used in the translate() function of the class Basis.

def djik(graph, source):
    '''
    Variant of Djikstra's algorithm to find the shortest path on a graph of 
    all nodes from a specified source node. Here all paths have length one 
    in order to find the path with the least number of steps. 
    Returns a dictionary of pointers to the next node on the shortest 
    path to the source node.
